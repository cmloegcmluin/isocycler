//  But actually the min out of all the durations which comprise them!
//  Yes I think that would be better
//  But then it's not Rpd at all anymore
//  It's... proportion of the absolute difference between halves to the minimum note = POTADBHTTMN
//  Or: Proportion of the Halves' Absolute Difference to the minimum note = PHADMN
//  Or: Halves' Absolute Difference Over Minimum Note = HADOMN
//  Or: Difference (Absolute) / Minimum Note = DAMN ADMN
//  Minimum Note Under Absolute Difference = MNUD
